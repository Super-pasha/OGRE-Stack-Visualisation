# OGRE-Stack-Visualisation
A stack visualisation which uses OGRE for rendering. Model contains stack panel, registers, asm code. Program reads xml file with assembler
instructions and "executes" them changing stack panel and values of registers. The point is to visualize the work of program stack like in a real 
program execution.

To use this project you need to build render engine OGRE and modify include directories in visual studio preferences. Then you will be able to compile the project files.
